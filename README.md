# Earthquake Emergency Response Robots

## Introduction
Welcome to the Earthquake Emergency Response Robots project! This project aims to create, develop, and implement systems specifically designed to handle post-earthquake situations using adaptable robots equipped with sensors and communication capabilities.

## Project Overview
The Earthquake Emergency Response Robots project is a capstone project undertaken by a team of 8 individuals. The main focus of this project is to build adaptable robots capable of post-earthquake response tasks. These robots are equipped with various sensors and communication capabilities to aid in their operations.
